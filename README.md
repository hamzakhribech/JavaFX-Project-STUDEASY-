Technologies Used

    JavaFX: The frontend of the system is developed using JavaFX, a Java-based framework for building desktop applications. JavaFX provides rich UI capabilities and enables the creation of interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.

    CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style the JavaFX UI components, allowing for customization of the application's appearance and layout.

    Database: The system employs a reliable and efficient database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL to store and retrieve student information, including their associated images.

    Authentication and Security: To ensure secure access to the system, authentication mechanisms such as email verification and password encryption are implemented.

    Image Storage: The STUDEASY system incorporates image storage capabilities, allowing administrators to upload and display student images. Image files are securely stored and associated with the respective student records.

    PDF Generation: Libraries such as iText or Apache PDFBox can be used in conjunction with JavaFX to generate PDF reports based on the student information provided, including their associated images.
